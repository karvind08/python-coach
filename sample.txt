What can partial functions do for us?

A partial function allows us to call a second function with fixed values in certain arguments. 
For instance, we may have a function that computes an exponentiation. 
Then, we may need to create a new function that assigns a fixed value to either the base or the exponent.
We can easily do this by using functool’s partial function, without having to replicate the body of the original function. Let’s go through the implementation of the above example to get a better understanding.
Implementing a partial exponentiation function
First of all, we’ll need the function from which the partial function will be based on. As mentioned before, we’ll implement an exponentiation function:


321-555-4321

456-654-4568

215.654.8546

135*546*5647

I beg to state that I have caught the flu since last night. This has left me unable to join the office for about (number of days). My doctor has advised me to take rest and not go to the office as it will only cause the virus to get worse. Enclosed, please see the doctor’s prescription.

I will be very thankful if you grant me a leave for (this number of) days. I can be contacted at any time through my phone. I have talked to Selena and she is happy to do any work of mine that needs to be done on an urgent basis.

Kindly approve this leave of absence. 


 
Thank you for considering.

Yours Truly,
(Name).

It is stated with respect that my presence in office for tomorrow won’t be possible. The reason is, I am feeling sick since many days and tomorrow I have to visit a friend of mine which is a doctor. I need to collect some reports as well about the testes which I’ve conducted last week. I hope my absence will not affect the tasks. I request you to please grant me leave for a day.

I shall remain thankful.
