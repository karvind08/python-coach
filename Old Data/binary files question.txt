=====================================================
Binary Files:

#1 A file sports.dat contains information in the following format: [event,participants] for each sportsperson. 

	# Write a function that would read contents from 'sports.dat' file and creates a file names 'athletics.dat' copying only those records from 'sports.dat' where the event name is 'athletics'.

#2 Consider the binary file as 'emp.dat' storing the details of employees such as empid, name, salary, gender and designation. 

	# Write a program to read all details from the file emp.dat. 

	# Write a program to search and display the details of a perticular employee whose empid is passed as a parameter to the function. 

	# Write a program to search and display the names of all employees whose salary is in the range of 50000 to 80000. 

	# Write a program to transfer all records from emp.dat file to emp1.dat file of those employees whose gender is 'M'.



#3 Write a program to read content from the binary file having information player id, player name, total runs and country and then perform the following operations. 

	# Input country name from the user and count the number of players of that country. 

	# Display all records where player names starts from a. 

	# Display records of players whose total runs are more than 10000.
